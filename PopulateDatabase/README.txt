run insertWebData.py to populate the database

NOTE: There are duplicates of some classes.
This is due to multiple professors teaching
the same class

currently insertWebData.py runs with ceias_fac_nau_ids.txt
But if faculty IDs were added from a different department
the script would theoretically still work(I have not tested)
