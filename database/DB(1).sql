For instance, many consumer electronics such as laptops, and smart phones contain multiple CPU cores that can be programmed to execute a program faster than only using a single core. Why do we care about CPU cores in smart phones and other modern computers? CPU clock speeds have become stagnant. Consequently, the number of processors packed onto a single chip continues to increase. No longer can an individual wait for a faster (e.g., higher clock speed) processor to be released to decrease the time it takes to run a program or to improve program responsiveness. Instead, computational resources need to be carefully exploited to reduce the time it takes to execute a program. Given the ubiquitous nature of multi-core computers, there is great demand for programmers that know how to exploit parallel architectures in industry, academia, and government labs. This course introduces students to parallel computing concepts in addition to a hands-on experience using key technologies and approaches used to program multi-core and many-core architectures. Students will learn about program optimization and performance evaluation for sequential and parallel programs. The hands-on approach is intended to ensure that students matriculating from the course will have the confidence needed to address the challenges of parallel computing in the real-world.

Topics include title and ownership principles, severance of rights in the estate, zoning considerations, easements, FAA and FCC regulations on airspace, wake effect case law, legal concepts of nuisance as they relate to wind turbine energy. Also covered will be basic corporations and contract law as related to financing of wind projects and Power Purchase Agreements. The course then addresses contracts including landowner leases and Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contracts, followed by relevant environmental health and safety issues and regulations, as well as federal wildlife regulations and treaties impacting wind power development.

Following this in-depth description of the wind turbine rotor blades will be a survey of several of the most important aspects of WECS, including: mechanics and dynamics; moments and natural frequencies; electrical power generation and grid interconnection; materials and components; wind turbine control; wind power plant design; environmental and regulatory considerations; and wind energy economics. Students will become familiar with the meaning and importance of key parameters and equations and be able to perform basic calculations. Upon completing the course, students will understand the salient aspects of wind turbine performance and design and will have the background necessary for advanced study of wind turbine design, wind power plant design, and wind power development. Cross-listed with ME 535 and WU@TTU 535.

This is an in-depth multidisciplinary course intended for students with a business, managerial, engineering, environmental or natural science background. It assumes some basic knowledge of STEM disciplines. The purpose of this course is to develop an understanding of the economic principles affecting wind project development from greenfield to decommissioning or repower. The course begins with an overview of basic financial and economic topics related to commercial-scale wind energy projects. Students will learn to complete and analyze a pro-forma invoice for a project, as well as the main financial agreements and their structuring, including risk assessment for projects and how insurance companies underwrite projects to secure financing. Decommissioning finance structures and costs will be addressed. Next, students will study energy policy and how it has evolved through a look at FERC and PURPA, including the PTC and ITC subsidies and how subsidies have evolved in the industry. Students will learn the basics of energy markets and how electricity is bought and sold. Finally, students will learn about the nexus of climate change and energy policy and eventually a discussion of offshore wind in the U.S. and its economics.

The goal of this class is to become proficient in wind turbine technology and wind turbine design. This will be accomplished via a semester long wind turbine design project, which will utilize modern wind turbine design and analysis codes, including those of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, such as TurbSim, Aerodyn, BModes and FAST as well as ancillary codes written in Excel, VBA or MATLAB.  Students will learn about the theory behind these codes as well as how to develop the input files, run the codes and analyze the results.  A technology review assignment will also be required for students to acquaint themselves with one particular technology in detail. This class operates like a seminar with lectures on specific topics, but also open discussions. There will reading assignments from a variety of sources to help introduce topics.  Students will be expected to learn somewhat independently; that is, the assignments and design project are not straightforward repetition of topics covered in class lectures. The design project includes of a sequence of linked assignments. As a design class, there will be a certain amount of trial and error.
